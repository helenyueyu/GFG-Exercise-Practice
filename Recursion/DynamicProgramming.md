How to solve a Dynamic Programming Problem?

DP - technique where you can solve problems in Polynomial time. 

1. Overlapping Subproblems
2. Optimal Substructure Property

1) Identify it is a DP problem
2) Decide a state expression with least parameters
3) Formulate state relationship
4) Do tabulation (or add memoization)
